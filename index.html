          <p class="lead">cSiTra is a project that aim to transform database model from SQL to NoSQL (currently supporting <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org">Cassandra</a>). This project uses <a href="http://baserg.github.io/sitra/">SiTra</a> as a powerful transformation library written in Java.</p>

          <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
          <p>Ever since the evolution of computer began a resource to the store the data in memory has been one of the vital components that has undergone mutation in the field of computer science and it has took many forms ever since. A new scheme has always come up whenever the amount of data to be stored increased and/or the existing scheme was no longer logically correct to be used. The computer file is such a resource for storing data, an analogy to the computer file can be a paper document which traditionally are kept in office and library files. Files (though sometimes still used as a primary source of data storage) however was haunted by many problems such as redundancy, inconsistency, isolation, and difficulty in accessing data when a lot of data was to be processed and stored in them and these backlogs gave way to the creation of Databases.</p>

          <p>Databases became a new way for storing data and it came over all the issues a file suffered and additionally provided atomicity and security to the data it hosts and an excellent support. However this was not really satisfactory a new urge to store data in a relational manner gave way to the relational databases. Relational databases stored data in a tabular form offered better security and integrity to the data and it could handle millions and millions of records of data and still do pretty well. They reigned the industry for a little more than two decades until the Internet was very big and companies like google, amazon started having problems with handling such big data in the relational databases the urge to store more data efficiently emerged again, and also that storing data relationally was not everybodyâ€™s piece of cake.</p>

          <p>Hence, the big NoSQL movement started in the industry, google came up with big table, and Amazon with dynamo, some research was done papers were published, conferences were held to discuss ideas and finally as a result the NoSQL databases came into picture. Though there is no De Facto definition for a NoSQL, only its characteristics were notable, like schema less, web and cluster friendly, non-relational and mainly data modelled. Many NoSQL databases were designed based on what kind of data they handle,</p>

          <ul>
            <li>MongoDB, CouchDB, RavenDB are good at handling Documents (like web DOMs, XML or JSON).</li>
            <li>Cassandra, HBase are good at column and families ( hashmap, 3D tables, RDBMS like tables).</li>
            <li>Project Voldemort, Redis good at storing Key-Value (hashmap or dictionary kind of stuff).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
          <p>The project aims at building a software that takes a relational database schema as input process its structure and data and outputs an equivalent Cassandra keyspace which is ready for further processing.</p>

          <p><strong>Why do we need this software and who can use it?</strong></p>
          <p>This software is a useful tool for anyone who wants to migrate their database from any of the traditional RDBMSs to Cassandra.</p>

          <p>As to why Cassandra this you have to ask yourself, as both RDBMSs and Cassandra are meant for different things. Here below we try to give a general checklist and if you think most of them mean something to you then the migration is recommended.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You need very high scalability.</li>
            <li>You are looking for better manageability and transaction (ACID) support.</li>
            <li>If your data be happy in a name-value pair columns and in turn arranged in rows.</li>
            <li>You are in need of a high performance distributed database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Then choose Cassandra.</p>
